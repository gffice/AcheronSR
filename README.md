## Installation

### From Source

#### Requirements

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

#### Building

##### Manually

```sh
git clone https://git.xeondev.com/reversedrooms/RobinSR.git
cd RobinSR
cargo install --path gameserver
cargo install --path sdkserver
```

##### Using xtasks (use this if stupid)

```sh
cargo xtask run
```

##### To run it with automatic recompilation when any Rust files are changed

```sh
cargo xtask watch
```

### From Pre-built Binaries

Navigate to the [Releases](https://git.xeondev.com/reversedrooms/RobinSR/releases)
page and download the latest release for your platform.

## Usage

To begin using the server, you need to run both the SDK server and the game server.

If you installed from source, Rust's installer should have added .cargo/bin to your
path, so simply run the following:

```sh
gameserver
sdkserver
```

If you installed from pre-built binaries, navigate to the directory where you downloaded
the binaries and either a) double-click on the following executable names or b)
run the following in a terminal:

```sh
./gameserver
./sdkserver
```
